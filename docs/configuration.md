# Configuration reference

Everything is driven by **`config.toml`** — the single, fully-commented source of default
settings, with **relative paths** so your checkout stays portable. Anything you change in the
[web Settings page](control-panel.md) or [by voice](using/settings.md) is written to
**`overrides.json`** and layered on top at runtime, so `config.toml` stays pristine.

!!! tip "Three ways to change a setting"
    Edit `config.toml` directly · toggle it on the [Settings page](control-panel.md) · or say it
    [by voice](using/settings.md). To **reset** a setting, delete its key from `overrides.json` or
    click **Reset** on the Settings page.

!!! warning "Enabling a capability applies on restart"
    Turning a whole feature on or off takes effect the next time you launch. A few settings (the
    Whisper model, bus volumes, some audio toggles) apply live.

This page groups the settings by their `config.toml` section. It's a reference — `config.toml`
itself carries a comment on every line.

---

## Voice input (`[keys]`)

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `keys.push_to_talk` | `[` | The key you **hold** to talk; a brief **tap** cancels |
| `keys.tap_cancel_ms` | `400` | A press shorter than this (ms) counts as a cancel tap, not speech |
| `keys.cancel` | *(blank)* | Optional dedicated cancel key (blank = cancel via a tap of the talk key) |

You can bind a joystick/HOTAS button to the talk key with a tool like JoyToKey.

## Microphone & audio device (`[audio]`)

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `audio.input_device` | *(your mic)* | Microphone, matched by name (blank = Windows default) |
| `audio.sample_rate` | `16000` | Mic sample rate — leave as-is (what the speech model expects) |
| `audio.tts_output_device` | *(blank)* | Output device (blank = default speakers/headset) |
| `audio.enabled` | `false` | **Master switch** for the [ambient audio layer](#ambient-audio-audio-music) |

## Speech-to-text (`[whisper]`)

Local speech recognition (faster-whisper) — nothing leaves your machine.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `whisper.model` | `small` | Model size: `tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large-v3` (bigger = more accurate, slower) |
| `whisper.device` | `cpu` | `cpu` (safe everywhere) or `cuda` (needs an NVIDIA GPU) |
| `whisper.compute_type` | `int8` | `int8` (fast/low memory on CPU), `float16`, or `float32` |
| `whisper.language` | `en` | Force a language code, or blank to auto-detect |

## Language model (`[anthropic]`)

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `anthropic.model` | `claude-sonnet-5` | Model used when the router is off (or as the pinned tier) |
| `anthropic.max_tokens` | `1024` | Hard cap on reply length — replies are spoken, so short is good |
| `anthropic.cache_ttl` | `1h` | Prompt-cache lifetime: `1h` survives long gaps between turns; `5m` is cheaper when chatting steadily |
| `anthropic.thinking.default` | `Off` | Extended-thinking depth: `Off`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Extra`, `Max` |

The Anthropic key isn't set here — enter it in the **first-run wizard** or the Settings **API keys**
card, and it's stored in `anthropic.api_key_file` (`AnthropicAPIKey.txt`).

> **How your keys are stored.** Every provider key (Anthropic, ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Gemini, Azure,
> Cartesia, Inara) is encrypted at rest with **Windows DPAPI** (`CurrentUser` scope) — never
> plaintext, and **environment variables are no longer read for keys** (#22). A plaintext key you
> paste into a `*APIKey.txt` file is migrated to a `DPAPI:<blob>` on first read. A blob won't
> decrypt on a different machine/account, so re-enter keys after a move. As defense-in-depth, use
> **spend-capped or restricted keys** where your provider offers them.

## Cost router (`[router]`)

Routes each turn to the cheapest capable model, escalating only when a turn earns it. See
[cost tiering](getting-started/voice-loop.md#cost-tiering-cheap-by-default-smart-when-it-matters).

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `router.enabled` | `true` | Turn the tiering router on |
| `router.default_model` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | The **cheap** tier's model (Anthropic provider) |
| `router.escalate_model` | `claude-sonnet-5` | The **standard** tier's model (depth/analysis, current data) |
| `router.premium_model` | `claude-opus-4-8` | The **premium** tier's model (explicit ask only) |
| `router.pin` | *(blank)* | Force every turn to a tier — `cheap`/`standard`/`premium` (or the aliases `haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus`); blank = let the rules decide |
| `router.full_breakdown_max_tokens` | `2048` | Raised reply cap for an explicit "full breakdown" turn |

The escalation phrases (`escalate_phrases`, `depth_phrases`, `web_phrases`, `premium_phrases`,
`full_breakdown_phrases`) are lists you can tune — the words that bump a turn to a higher tier or
raise the length cap.

> **Provider-agnostic tiers.** The router picks a canonical **tier** — `cheap` / `standard` /
> `premium` — and the model comes from the active `[llm].provider`'s tier map. For Anthropic that's
> the three `router.*_model` settings above (and `[anthropic].model` when the router is off). A
> different provider supplies its own map via `[<provider>].tiers.{cheap,standard,premium}` (or a
> single `[<provider>].model`), so the same routing policy works for any cloud LLM.

## Web search (`[web_search]`)

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `web_search.enabled` | `true` | Let Claude search the web when it needs current info |
| `web_search.max_uses` | `3` | Max searches per reply (each one inflates later turns too — keep it low) |

## Personality (`[personality]`)

See [Personas & voice](using/personas-voice.md).

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `personality.enabled` | `true` | Compose the in-character system prompt (Base + Persona + Campaign) |

| `personality.presets_file` | `personalities/presets.md` | Shipped, committed presets (no personal data) |
| `personality.custom_dir` | `personalities/custom` | Where your saved custom personas live (git-ignored) |
| `personality.campaign_file` | `campaign.txt` | Your personal Commander facts (git-ignored) |

## Text-to-speech (`[elevenlabs]`, `[tts]`, `[piper]`, `[edge]`, `[azure]`, `[openai_tts]`, `[cartesia]`)

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `tts.provider` | `edge` | Which voice speaks: `edge` (free neural, no key/SLA — falls back to Piper; the default), `azure` (official Azure Neural, free tier + SLA), `openai` (cheap cloud, OpenAI-compatible), `cartesia` (low-latency premium persona), `elevenlabs` (cloud, premium), or `piper` (local, free) |
| `elevenlabs.model` | `eleven_flash_v2_5` | ElevenLabs TTS model (flash = low latency) |
| `elevenlabs.voice_id` | *(Sarah)* | Which ElevenLabs voice speaks |
| `elevenlabs.speed` | `1.0` | Speaking speed, clamped to `1.0`–`1.2` |
| `elevenlabs.output_format` | `pcm_16000` | Audio format (low-latency, cancellable — change only if you know why) |
| `piper.model` | *(blank)* | Path to a local Piper `.onnx` voice (for `tts.provider = "piper"`) |
| `edge.voice` | `en-US-AriaNeural` | Edge voice ShortName for `tts.provider = "edge"` (list: `python -m edge_tts --list-voices`) |
| `azure.region` | `eastus` | Azure Speech resource region for `tts.provider = "azure"` (must match your resource) |
| `azure.voice` | `en-US-AriaNeural` | Azure Neural voice ShortName (same names as Edge) |
| `azure.style` | *(blank)* | Optional SSML speaking style/emotion (voice-dependent), e.g. `cheerful`, `newscast` |
| `openai_tts.base_url` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | OpenAI-compatible `audio/speech` endpoint for `tts.provider = "openai"` (point at any compatible endpoint) |
| `openai_tts.model` | `gpt-4o-mini-tts` | OpenAI TTS model (`gpt-4o-mini-tts` cheap, or `tts-1`) |
| `openai_tts.voice` | `alloy` | OpenAI voice name (alloy, ash, ballad, coral, echo, fable, nova, onyx, sage, shimmer, verse) |
| `openai_tts.instructions` | *(blank)* | Optional tone/delivery steer (newer models only, e.g. gpt-4o-mini-tts) |
| `cartesia.model` | `sonic-2` | Cartesia Sonic model for `tts.provider = "cartesia"` (low-latency premium **persona** voice) |
| `cartesia.voice` | *(blank)* | Cartesia voice id (**required** for `cartesia` — get one from play.cartesia.ai or `GET /voices`) |
| `cartesia.language` | `en` | Synthesis language (BCP-47 primary subtag) for the Cartesia voice |
| `elevenlabs.api_key_file` | `ElevenLabsAPIKey.txt` | Where the ElevenLabs key is read from — DPAPI-encrypted at rest, git-ignored; enter it on the Settings **API keys** card |

| `openai_tts.api_key_file` | `OpenAIAPIKey.txt` | Where the OpenAI key is read from — DPAPI-encrypted at rest, git-ignored; enter it on the Settings **API keys** card |
| `cartesia.api_key_file` | `CartesiaAPIKey.txt` | Where the Cartesia key is read from — DPAPI-encrypted at rest, git-ignored; enter it on the Settings **API keys** card |

> **Edge (`edge-tts`) is optional and not load-bearing.** It uses an undocumented, no-SLA Microsoft
> endpoint that periodically breaks; when it's down the persona voice falls back to Piper (or degrades
> to text) and cast Edge voices fall silent. Keep a Piper model configured as the guaranteed free floor.
>
> **Azure Neural TTS is Edge's reliable sibling** — the *same* voices over the official Speech
> service, with an API, an SLA, and a **free tier (~0.5M chars/month)**. Needs a Speech resource key
> (enter it on the Settings **API keys** card, stored in `AzureSpeechKey.txt`) + its `region`. No ToS/reliability asterisk —
> the shippable low/zero-cost way to give the cast big voice variety.
>
> **OpenAI-compatible TTS (`openai`)** is a **cheap cloud** voice — a small fixed voice set, so it's
> best as a persona or a supplemental cast voice. `base_url` is configurable, so any OpenAI-compatible
> endpoint works. Needs an OpenAI key (enter it on the Settings **API keys** card, stored in
> `OpenAIAPIKey.txt`) — the same key is shared with a future OpenAI LLM provider.
>
> **Cartesia (`cartesia`)** is a **low-latency premium persona** voice (Cartesia Sonic) — a snappier
> alternative to ElevenLabs for COVAS's own voice; it **streams** so the first audio starts fast. It's
> **persona-only** — not offered for the NPC/comms/chatter cast. Needs a Cartesia key (enter it on the
> Settings **API keys** card, stored in `CartesiaAPIKey.txt`) and a `voice` id.

## Conversation (`[conversation]`)

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `conversation.max_turns` | `20` | How many recent turns of history to keep for follow-ups |

## Sound cues (drop-in folders)

Local sounds played instantly at each stage — see [The voice loop](getting-started/voice-loop.md#sound-cues).
There is **no `[sound_cues]` config section**: cues are resolved by folder. Cue types are
`listen`, `processing`, `completed`, `failure`, and `thinking`, each a folder holding any number of
audio files (a random one plays). COVAS++ ships originals under `covas/assets/cues/<type>/`; drop
your own into `<data dir>/sounds/<type>/` to replace a type's default set (use **Open cues folder**
in the control panel). Empty a folder to fall back; the app runs fine either way.

The `thinking` type is special: it's a soft bed that **loops** while COVAS transcribes/thinks/
searches (issue #5), filling the wait between "prompt received" and "reply starts," and stops the
instant the reply speaks or you cancel. Files you drop into `sounds/thinking/` should loop cleanly.
Turn the whole bed off with `[audio].thinking_bed = false` (or the **Thinking sound** Settings row /
*"turn the thinking sound off"*) to keep just the one-shot `processing` tick.

> **Upgrading from an old `[sound_cues]` config?** The per-file arrays are ignored now. Move (or
> re-drop) your files into `sounds/listen/`, `sounds/processing/`, `sounds/completed/`, and
> `sounds/failure/` — note `done`→`completed` and `failed`→`failure`.

## Checklist (`[checklist]`)

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `checklist.file` | `ultimate_checklist.md` | Your checklist markdown file (git-ignored) |

|---------|---------|--------------|
| `memory.enabled` | `true` | Master switch for loading/saving memory |
| `memory.dir` | `memory` | Folder (under your data dir) holding `memory.jsonl` (git-ignored) |
| `memory.embedding.enabled` | `false` | Opt in to semantic recall (costs money; off = free keyword recall) |
| `memory.embedding.provider` | *(blank)* | Name of an embedding backend (none available yet) |

## Elite Dangerous (`[elite]`)

Game-state monitoring — see [Game-state monitoring](elite/monitoring.md). **Enable this first**;
most Elite features depend on it.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `elite.enabled` | `true` | Tail the journal + `Status.json` for live context |
| `elite.journal_dir` | *(blank)* | Journal location (blank = the standard Saved Games path) |
| `elite.journal_poll_interval` | `0.5` | How often (s) to re-scan the journal for new lines |
| `elite.status_poll_interval` | `1.0` | How often (s) to poll `Status.json` for flag changes |
| `elite.recent_events_kept` | `25` | How many recent events feed "what just happened" |

The `context_wake`, `status_phrases`, and `log_phrases` lists control which spoken turns pull in
live telemetry (and the "context" wake word) — tune them from your own transcripts.

## Proactive callouts (`[proactive]`)

See [Proactive callouts](elite/proactive-callouts.md).

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `proactive.enabled` | `true` | Let the companion volunteer short lines on notable events |
| `proactive.min_interval` | `20` | Minimum seconds between any two callouts |
| `proactive.cooldown` | `120` | Seconds before the same event type may re-announce |
| `proactive.max_tokens` | `120` | Reply length cap for a callout |
| `[proactive.events]` | *(see file)* | Per-event whitelist (`FSDJump`, `Docked`, `MissionCompleted`, `LowFuel`, `Overheating`, `Died`) |

## Route callouts (`[route]`)

See [Route callouts](elite/route-callouts.md). **Off by default.**

| Setting | Default | What it does |

| `route.callout_arrival` | `true` | Announce arrival at the destination |

## Keybind automation (`[keybinds]`)

| `keybinds.allowlist` | `["landing_gear"]` | The only macros the companion may run |

## Auto-honk (`[honk]`)

See [Auto-honk](automation/auto-honk.md). **Off by default** — it presses a fire button.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `honk.enabled` | `true` | Master switch (on by default; no fire-group setup — probes and recovers from a Surface-Scanner misfire) |

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `nav.enabled` | `true` | Outfitting **and** ship search |

| `search.search_size` | `50` | How many nearby matches to fetch |

The `[nav]`, `[star_systems]`, and `[search]` sections also carry `base_url` / `user_agent` values
for the Spansh API — you rarely need to touch these.

## Trade-route planner (`[route_plan]`)

See [Trade-route planner](search/trade-routes.md). **Off by default.**

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `route_plan.enabled` | `false` | Master switch — voice-plan a Spansh trade loop from where you're docked |
| `route_plan.default_max_hops` | `4` | Hops in the loop when you don't say |
| `route_plan.max_price_age_days` | `2` | Prices older than this get a spoken "may have moved" caveat |

Needs [`[elite].enabled`](elite/monitoring.md) for the live docked-station start. The next stop is
copied to your clipboard for the galaxy map (in-game course-set arrives with the keybind actions).

## Community goals (`[cg]`)

See [Community goals](elite/community-goals.md).

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `cg.source` | `inara` | `inara` (external feed) or `none` (journal-only) |
| `cg.api_key_file` | `InaraAPIKey.txt` | Where the free Inara key is read from — DPAPI-encrypted at rest, git-ignored; enter it on the Settings **API keys** card |
| `cg.inara_api_key` | *(blank)* | **Deprecated** — a legacy inline key here is migrated into the encrypted `InaraAPIKey.txt` on first run, then blanked |

## Ambient audio (`[audio]`, `[music]`)

The optional [atmospheric audio layer](audio/ambient-audio.md). **All off by default.**

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|

| `audio.voices.cast_provider` | `elevenlabs` | Default TTS for the NPC/comms/chatter cast: `elevenlabs` (random voices, burns credits), `piper` (local, free), `edge` (free neural, no key/SLA), `azure` (official Azure Neural, free tier + SLA), or `openai` (cheap cloud) |
| `audio.voices.providers.*` | *(unset)* | Per-role provider overrides (`comms`/`chatter`/`player`/`interdiction`/`captain`/`tower`); fall back to `cast_provider`. Persona uses `[tts].provider` |
| `audio.voices.random_el` | `true` | With no pool set, cast from random ElevenLabs voices (minus the COVAS voice) |

The comms radio treatment (band limits, static, compression), the SFX/music track lists, and the
voice-cast pool live in the same sections — see the comments in `config.toml`.

## Control panel (`[ui]`)

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `ui.host` | `127.0.0.1` | Interface the control panel binds to (restart to apply) |
| `ui.port` | `8765` | Port the control panel serves on (restart to apply) |

## Providers & developer (`[llm]`, `[tts]`, `[dev]`)

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `llm.provider` | `anthropic` | `anthropic` (cloud, Claude), `openai` (any OpenAI-compatible cloud — OpenAI/Groq/DeepSeek/OpenRouter), `gemini` (Google Gemini native — function calling + Search grounding), or `ollama` (local, out-of-game only) |
| `openai.base_url` / `.model` | OpenAI / `gpt-4o-mini` | OpenAI-compatible `chat/completions` endpoint + router-off model when `llm.provider = "openai"`; per-tier models live in `[openai.tiers]` |

| `edge.voice` | `en-US-AriaNeural` | Edge voice ShortName when `tts.provider = "edge"` |
| `azure.region` / `azure.voice` / `azure.style` | `eastus` / `en-US-AriaNeural` / *(blank)* | Azure Neural region, voice ShortName, and optional SSML style when `tts.provider = "azure"` |
| `openai_tts.base_url` / `.model` / `.voice` / `.instructions` | OpenAI / `gpt-4o-mini-tts` / `alloy` / *(blank)* | OpenAI-compatible endpoint, model, voice, and optional tone steer when `tts.provider = "openai"` |
| `cartesia.model` / `.voice` / `.language` | `sonic-2` / *(blank)* / `en` | Cartesia Sonic model, voice id, and language when `tts.provider = "cartesia"` (persona-only) |
| `dev.mock` | `false` | Swap LLM/TTS/STT for fakes — exercise the loop with zero API calls (restart to apply) |

> **OpenAI-compatible LLM (`llm.provider = "openai"`).** One implementation covers **OpenAI, Groq,
> DeepSeek, and OpenRouter** — only `[openai].base_url` and the model ids differ (see the presets in
> `config.toml`). It's a **cloud** provider, so it's fine in-game and the [cost router](#cost-router-router)
> tiers it via `[openai.tiers].{cheap,standard,premium}`. Tool calling (the checklist voice commands)
> works; there is **no web-search** on this path (Anthropic-only). Needs an OpenAI key (enter it on the
> Settings **API keys** card, stored in `OpenAIAPIKey.txt` — shared with the OpenAI TTS provider). A
> request error degrades the turn to text, never crashing the loop.
>
> **Gemini LLM (`llm.provider = "gemini"`).** Google Gemini on the **native** API — strong **tool
> calling** plus Google-Search **grounding** (surfaced like web search when `web_search.enabled` is on),
> and a cheap/fast **Flash** default tier (Pro for depth) via `[gemini.tiers]`. Cloud, so in-game is
> fine. Needs a Gemini key (enter it on the Settings **API keys** card, stored in `GeminiAPIKey.txt`) —
> a free key comes from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com). Fail soft: a request error degrades the turn to
> text. (Combining function calling + grounding needs a Gemini 2.x model; older models may reject the
> combo — turn `web_search.enabled` off for those.)

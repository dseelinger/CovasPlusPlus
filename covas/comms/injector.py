"""Text-injection seam for in-game comms (issue #49, DESIGN §6).

THE TRICKY BIT of "send a message by voice": unlike a landing-gear toggle (one scancode), a
chat message is arbitrary CHARACTER input. Two candidate paths:

  1. per-character `SendInput` — replay the whole string as scancodes. Fragile: it has to map
     every character to a scancode + shift-state on the Commander's keyboard layout, and
     dead keys / AltGr / IME all break it.
  2. **clipboard-paste** — put the finished string on the Windows clipboard and paste it into
     ED's focused chat box with **Ctrl+V**. The OS handles the character mapping; we send two
     fixed keystrokes regardless of message content.

We take path 2 (clipboard-paste) — the more reliable one — reusing the existing clipboard
writer (`covas/nav/clipboard.py`, `clip.exe`, no new dependency). This module is that seam:
`ClipboardTextInjector.inject(text)` copies + pastes, and `.send()` presses Enter to commit.
Both the clipboard writer and the key executor are injected, so the whole thing is unit-tested
offline with a recording fake executor + a fake clipboard — no real input, no real clipboard.

`PASTE_BINDING` / `SEND_BINDING` are CONSTRUCTED `KeyBinding`s, not ED `.binds` action tokens:
Ctrl+V and Enter are OS/text-field keystrokes the game doesn't rebind, so we hardcode the key
tokens and let the shared scancode executor press them exactly like any other binding.
